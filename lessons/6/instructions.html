  <p>Let's move up to a bigger example with 9 shape types.  Try matching
  the gray outlines now.  The log-likelihood bar tells you how well you're
  matching them overall.</p>

  <p><b>Getting hints.</b> In this larger problem, it's hard to decide which sliders to
    move.  So, let's get some automatic help!  Check the "Show
    gradient" checkbox.  Now each slider shows a hint about the best
    direction to move it.  
    <ul>
      <li>Move the weight along the hint bar to improve the
	log-likelihood.  
      <li>The direction of the hint bar is also color-coded.  Red says to
	increase, blue says to decrease.
      <li>A long hint bar indicates that the log-likelihood is very
	sensitive to this weight.  You can increase the log-likelihood 
	<i>rapidly</i> by moving the slider in that direction.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>Try following the hints on the sliders to match the gray outlines.
  Easier?</p>

  <p>Drag the <code>triangle</code> slider back and forth to make its weight
    very big and very small.  As you do this, what happens to the hint
    on the triangle slider?  What happens to the hints on the 
  <code>circle</code> and <code>square</code> sliders?  Why?</p>
 
  <p><b>Understanding the hints.</b> Recall the two games from
  <a href="#3" target="_blank">lesson 3</A>.  The hint on the slider can be interpreted as a hint
  for <i>either</i> game.

    <ul>
      <li><p><b>Log-likelihood game.</b> Following the hint on
      the <code>circle</code> slider will increase the log-likelihood.
      That's because the length of the hint bar is the partial
      derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to
      the <code>circle</code> weight.</p>

      <li><p><b>Matching game.</b> Following the same hint will also
      improve the match between the expected and observed number of
      circles.  That's because the length of the hint bar is (observed
      circles - expected circles).</p>
    </ul>

    <p>These two lengths are the same.  The formula for the partial
    derivative is simply (observed - expected), as shown in section 3
    of the <A HREF="pdf/formulas.pdf">handout</A>.</p> 

  <p>In fact, why not try lessons <a href="#3" target="_blank">3</a>
  and <a href="#4" target="_blank">4</a> again using the
  hints?  <i>Much</i> easier! </p>

  <p><b>Extra fun.</b> If you enjoy trying to match the gray outlines,
  you can get more puzzles of this kind.  Clicking "New random
  challenge" (at the top of the page) picks a new log-linear
  distribution and samples <i>N</i> observed events from it.  Your job
  as a statistician is to use those <i>N</i> events (the gray counts
  and gray outlines) as clues to help you guess the true distribution.
  You can do a good job by playing the games above to maximize
  log-likelihood.  Then click "Peek!" to reveal the true parameters
  and how well <i>they</i> would do on log-likelihood.  (But remember
  <a href="#2" target="_blank">lesson 2</a>, and don't be disappointed if
  you found different parameters that define exactly the same
  distribution.)</p>

  <p><i>Warning:</i> Reducing <i>N</i> before you generate the new
  challenge will give you fewer clues&mdash;making your statistical
  task harder!  Your random sample of <i>N</i> events will be sparse
  and perhaps idiosyncratic.  In fact, you can see the <i>variance</i>
  among random samples by clicking "New counts" to see another sample
  you could have gotten&mdash;with different observed counts indicated
  by the different-sized gray outlines.  So if you try too hard to
  match them, you might be overfitting the training data (achieving an
  even better training log-likelihood than the true parameters would)
  rather than finding the true parameters.  More about
  that <a href="#8">soon</a> ...</p>
