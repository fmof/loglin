  <p>This is exactly the same setting as the <A HREF="#11">previous
    lesson</A>.  We're merely replacing the three languages by shapes.
    So now the second row shows the probability that a circle would
    be <code>solid</code>, <code>striped</code>,
    or <code>hollow</code>: that is, p(<code>solid</code>
    | <code>circle</code>), p(<code>striped</code>
    | <code>circle</code>), p(<code>hollow</code>
    | <code>circle</code>).</p>

  <p>We'll use this setup for the next several lessons.  Notice that
    the <code>solid</code> feature is shared across different shapes.
    It controls the rate of solid
    <i>triangles</i> within the solid row, but it controls the rate of solid
    <i>circles</i> within the circle row.</p>

  <p>Unlike the joint model of <A HREF="#6">lesson 6</A>, the
  conditional model does <i>not</i> try to predict the probability of
  circles.  The total expected number of circles is fixed
  (at <i>N</i><sub><code>circle</code></sub> = 100), a number that is
  taken directly from the training data.  The model only tries to
  predict the fill pattern <i>given</i> that it has a circle.</p>
